        <li>1 pound bulk mild Italian sausage</li>
        <li>1 ¼ teaspoons crushed red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>4 slices bacon, cut into 1/2 inch pieces</li>
        <li>1 large onion, diced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>5 (13.75 ounce) cans chicken broth</li>
        <li>6 medium potatoes, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>¼ bunch fresh spinach, tough stems removed</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Directions</h1>
    <ol>
            <h3>Step 1</h3>
            <p>Cook Italian sausage and red pepper flakes in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat until crumbly, browned, and no longer pink, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain and set aside.</p>
        <h3>Step 2</h3><P>Cook bacon in the same Dutch oven over medium heat until crisp, about 10 minutes. Drain, leaving a few tablespoons of drippings with the bacon in the bottom of the Dutch oven. Stir in onions and garlic; cook until onions are soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.</P>
        <h3>Step 3</h3><p>Stir in chicken broth and bring to a boil over high heat. Add potatoes and simmer until fork tender, about 20 minutes. Reduce heat to medium; stir in cream, cooked sausage, and spinach. Cook and stir until spinach has wilted and sausage is warmed through; serve.</p>
